# Tax rates and the social security wage base limit.   Social security and
# Medicare taxes have different rates and only the social security tax has a
# wage base limit. The wage base limit is the maximum wage subject to the tax
# for the year. Determine the amount of withholding for social security and
# Medicare taxes by multiplying each payment by the employee tax rate. There are
# no withholding allowances for social security and Medicare taxes.
# 
# For 2016, the social security tax rate is 6.2% (amount withheld) each for the
# employer and employee (12.4% total). The social security wage base limit is
# $118,500. The tax rate for Medicare is 1.45% (amount withheld) each for the
# employee and employer (2.9% total). There is no wage base limit for Medicare
# tax; all covered wages are subject to Medicare tax.
# 
# Additional Medicare Tax withholding.   In addition to withholding Medicare tax
# at 1.45%, you must withhold a 0.9% Additional Medicare Tax from wages you pay
# to an employee in excess of $200,000 in a calendar year. You are required to
# begin withholding Additional Medicare Tax in the pay period in which you pay
# wages in excess of $200,000 to an employee and continue to withhold it each
# pay period until the end of the calendar year. Additional Medicare Tax is only
# imposed on the employee. There is no employer share of Additional Medicare
# Tax. All wages that are subject to Medicare tax are subject to Additional
# Medicare Tax withholding if paid in excess of the $200,000 withholding
# threshold.
